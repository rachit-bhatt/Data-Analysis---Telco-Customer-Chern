# Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer data to identify factors contributing to customer churn and builds a predictive model to identify customers likely to churn. The project utilizes various data science techniques and tools.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw and processed data.
- `Telco Customer Chern.ipynb`: Jupyter notebooks with code and explanations.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the notebooks or scripts to reproduce the analysis and models.

## Results
Our best model `Random Forest` achieved:
- Accuracy: 78%
- Precision: 63%
- Recall: 42%
- F1 Score: 50%

## Future Work
- Explore more advanced models.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning.
- Investigate additional features.
